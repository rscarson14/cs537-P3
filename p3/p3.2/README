This project dealt with implementing a memory allocator and exploring three
different allocation methods.  I chose to implement my memory allocator 
using header and footer spaces that contained the size of the block and if
it was free or allocated.  After reading the book, I employed the use of 
some macros for common calculations pertaining to the headers/footers. This
method makes the code easier to read and shorter.  For the first-fit policy,
I traversed the list of blocks, checking if they were free and could hold
the requested block size; if they could I returned a pointer to that block.
For both worst-fit and best-fit, I traversed the entire list searching for 
the best fit (or worst fit), and then(if one was found) returned a pointer 
to the block after the entire list was traversed.  Free works the same for 
each policy, as does my coalesce function.
